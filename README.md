## Installation
1. Download BepInEx.NetLauncher.zip from https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be
2. Extract to game directory
3. Run `BepInEx.NetLauncher.exe` (`eval $(echo "%command%" | sed "s/JumpKing.exe/BepInEx.NetLauncher.exe/g")` in steam launch options if you are on linux)
4. Copy `QuickJumpKing.dll` to `BepInEx/plugins`

## TODO
- [ ] - Upload jumpking dlls to [bepinex nuget](https://nuget-upload.bepinex.dev/) if someone actually wants to use bepinex for jump king mods (note: find someone else to do this so I don't have to maintain it)
